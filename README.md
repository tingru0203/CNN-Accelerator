# CNN-Accelerator

## HW1
* Train a CNN model similar to LeNet-5 in Pytorch
* Do post-training quantization, including quantizing weights, quantizing activations, quantizing biases

## HW2
* Implement the inference model pretrained in hw1, including convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layer with 8-bit quantization of the activations and weights accordingly

## HW3
* Implement a CNN accelerator for the quantized LeNet model in Verilog
